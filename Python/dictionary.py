"""Introduction to Python Dictionaries
A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs.

It provides us with a way to map pieces of data to each other so that we can quickly find values that are associated with one another.

Suppose we want to store the prices of various items sold at a cafe:

Avocado Toast is 6 dollars
Carrot Juice is 5 dollars
Blueberry Muffin is 2 dollars
In Python, we can create a dictionary called menu to store this data:

menu = {"avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}

Notice that:

A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces { and }.
Each item consists of a key ("avocado toast") and a value (6).
Each key: value pair is separated by a comma.
It’s considered good practice to insert a space ( ) after each comma, but our code will still run without the space."""


sensors =  {"living room": 21, "kitchen": 23, "bedroom": 20, "pantry": 22}
num_cameras = {"backyard": 6,  "garage": 2, "driveway": 1}

print(sensors)

"""Make a Dictionary
In the previous exercise, we saw a dictionary that maps strings to numbers (i.e., "avocado toast": 6). However, the keys can be numbers as well.

For example, if we were mapping restaurant bill subtotals to the bill total after tip, a dictionary could look like:

subtotal_to_total = {20: 24, 10: 12, 5: 6, 15: 18}

Values can be of any type. We can use a string, a number, a list, or even another dictionary as the value associated with a key!

For example:

students_in_classes = {"software design": ["Aaron", "Delila", "Samson"], "cartography": ["Christopher", "Juan", "Marco"], "philosophy": ["Frederica", "Manuel"]}

The list ["Aaron", "Delila", "Samson"], which is the value for the key "software design", represents the students in that class.

We can also mix and match key and value types. For example:

person = {"name": "Shuri", "age": 18, "family": ["T'Chaka", "Ramonda"]}
